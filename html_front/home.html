                <td>The Saints aren't wasting any time finding Sean Payton's replacement, and the list of candidates includes a Super Bowl-winning coach.New Orleans interviewed former Eagles coach Doug Pederson on Sunday, NFL Network Insider Ian Rapoport reported. The Saints' coaching search continues this week with plans to interview former Dolphins coach Brian Flores on Tuesday, current Lions defensive coordinator Aaron Glenn on Wednesday and current defensive coordinator Dennis Allen on either Wednesday or Thursday, per Rapoport.Pederson has not coached since the 2020 season, his last in Philadelphia before he and the Eagles agreed to part ways at the conclusion of the campaign. Prior to his departure, Pederson had built up plenty of goodwill in Philadelphia, leading the Eagles to a 13-3 finish in 2017 that included a three-win run through the postseason to the franchise's first Super Bowl triumph. A product of the Andy Reid coaching tree, Pederson endeared himself to Eagles fans who'd never seen their team reach the mountaintop by proving he could pursue (and ultimately win) a title with not one, but two quarterbacks, and lead them through external doubt to football's promised land.Eventually, though, the magic dissipated, with a nightmarish 2020 season spelling the end of both Pederson's and Carson Wentz's time in Philadelphia. Pederson has spent the last year out of football, but has been a notable name in this hiring cycle, carrying with him a demonstrated ability to direct a football team toward serious Super Bowl contention, provided the talent is adequate.Flores joined the coaching pool via a surprise firing that appeared to be the product of internal discord more than it was about on-field performance. Flores was seen as an up-and-coming head coach in Miami and led the Dolphins on an impressive in-season turnaround despite constant questions regarding his quarterback situation, nearly reaching the postseason after starting 2021 with a 1-7 record. Flores has been a hot candidate with a bright future throughout much of the cycle.Glenn and Allen each have history in New Orleans. Glenn just completed his first season as a defensive coordinator in Detroit following five seasons spent working under Allen as the Saints' defensive backs coach. Glenn's ascension to head coach would be rapid, but not entirely surprising, considering this isn't the first head-coaching opening for which he's interviewed in this cycle.Allen has head coaching experience, serving in the role for the then-Oakland Raiders from 2012-2014. Allen won eight combined games in his first two seasons while guiding a talent-poor Raiders squad before he was fired following an 0-4 start to the 2014 season. He's since worked for the Saints as their defensive coordinator and overseen a steady transformation from one of the league's worst defenses (31st in 2015, 27th in 2016) into one of its best units in recent years, landing in the top seven in total yards allowed per game in each of the last two seasons.Though they have some significant cap gymnastics to perform to remedy their current salary situation, the Saints are positioned to contend for an NFC South crown in 2022, provided they can address quarterback (the only quarterbacks currently under contract are Payton favorite ﻿Taysom Hill﻿ and ﻿Ian Book﻿). With Tom Brady's retirement anticipated, the NFC South appears to be wide open, meaning the Saints are in the market for a coach who can step in and do the job well from day one. Such an opening could be attractive to veteran coaches looking for another shot at leading a team that isn't going to include a massive rebuild.</td>

                <td>New York Giants' new head football coach Brian Daboll is tasked with rehabbing the career of quarterback Daniel Jones, who has struggled with consistency in his first three years as Big Blue has shuffled through coaches.In his introductory news conference Monday, Daboll said supporting the 24-year-old signal-caller is priority No. 1."There's a lot of things to like about Daniel, and we'll just take it one day at a time, we'll work with him, we'll help him get better," the new coach said. "We'll help him be a better leader, we'll help him be everything. That's our job as a coaching staff and as an organization. It takes everybody. It's not just me. It's the rest of the coaches on our staff, it's the scouts, it's the support staff, it's the ownership group. It takes a lot to raise a quarterback, if you will. He's been around the block these last three years with some different pieces. We're going to try to give him some stability and just take it from there."Since Jones was selected No. 6 overall in 2019, the Giants have lacked stability. Daboll will be the third head coach the QB has worked under, and Jones will have his fourth offensive coordinator in four years.Daboll was a hot coaching candidate due largely to his work with the Bills' Josh Allen, who developed into an MVP candidate under the former Buffalo OC. The thread will undoubtedly lead to comparisons between the offense the Bills employed and the system Daboll brings to New York. But the new coach dismissed comparing Allen and Jones."We're going to take it day by day," Daboll said. "We're not going to make any predictions, and I wouldn't do that to Daniel or really any player. I don't think that's fair to compare him to another guy that I was working with. He's himself. We're going to find out what he does well, we're going to try to implement a system that suits him, and then it's our job to bring pieces in that help him to be the best version of himself and the best quarterback for us. He's got the right mindset, he's got good size."Daboll declined to comment on whether he would be the play-caller in New York or if that task would go to the next offensive coordinator.The 46-year-old first-time head coach said the key would be building an offense around what Jones and the other Giants playmakers do best. That starts with finding out what the QB is comfortable in."One of the things that I asked him to do, and I said you can give this to me at any time -- he was one of the players that called me after it was announced, amongst some other guys -- I said, hey, give me some things that you really like in your last three years, or if you did at Duke," Daboll said. "And that's where it's going to start, is some foundational pieces that he feels comfortable with. ... I think this is going to be a day-to-day process, I'm not going to put any expectations on him. I know he wants to do well, he's got the right mindset, he's dedicated, he's a hard worker, and I'm looking forward to working with him."With the Giants intent on sticking with Jones at this stage, getting the most out of the quarterback will define the early stages of Daboll's tenure in New York.Elsewhere during his presser, Daboll confirmed NFL Network Insider Ian Rapoport's report that Patrick Graham will remain the Giants defensive coordinator if he doesn't get a head coaching job. Graham is a candidate for the Minnesota Vikings' vacancy.</td>

                <td>From the proverbial couch to the Super Bowl.The Los Angeles Rams stunningly signed Eric Weddle ahead of their postseason run after injuries to their safety crew left them woefully thin. The 37-year-old had been retired for two full seasons after walking away following the Rams' 2019 season.At the time of the signing, it appeared Weddle might simply be insurance. A savvy veteran who knew the system, could play in certain packages and could fill the gaps left by Jordan Fuller's season-ending ankle injury and Taylor Rapp, who remains in concussion protocol.Upon returning from retirement, this is what Weddle said he expected his participation level to be:"I think I can still help for 15 or 20 snaps or whatever they need," Weddle said, via the Orange County Register. "It's amazing, how great I feel. I've lost some weight, I've taken some of the toll off my knees and back. I've been training like a madman."Oh, boy, has he been more than a 20-snap player for the Super Bowl-bound Rams.After just 19 snaps in the wild-card win over the Arizona Cardinals, Weddle has been a full-time defender, netting 60 plays in the Divisional Round win over Tampa Bay and playing all 50 snaps in the NFC Championship victory over rival San Francisco.Weddle isn't just on the field. He's been a difference-maker for a Rams defense that boasts stars like Aaron Donald and Jalen Ramsey.Sunday, the man who was playing pick-up basketball three weeks ago led L.A. with nine tackles in the NFC Championship win. Those weren't just hollow clean-up-the-play stats, either. Despite being out of the game for two seasons, Weddle proved he still has the timing and acumen to make plays.With the Niners holding a three-point lead near midfield, facing a second-and-1, Weddle knifed through the offensive line and chopped running back Elijah Mitchell down for a 1-yard loss. When L.A. stuffed Kyle Juszczyk on third-and-2, it forced a punt from Kyle Shanahan that allowed the Rams to tie the game and eventually take the lead in the 20-17 victory.Weddle returned from retirement to chase the elusive Super Bowl ring that evaded him in 13 seasons with the Chargers, Ravens and Rams. He's got that shot after Sunday's performance.The man who famously had an "ice cream clause" in his contract could be in for the biggest sundae of his career in Super Bowl LVI.</td>

               <td>While these and many more legends have grown to enduring status, there should be legitimate concern that the reality of the conditions in which they occurred could be lost to time. In a country that is both fighting to be beyond racial divides and combating some clear polarizations that could reverse those efforts, the importance of the era that housed the Negro Leagues and the success that they ultimately bred deserves to be kept prominent and in current context. The idea that we are at a "finish line" of any sort regarding the Negro Leagues era, due to the integration mark being three decades behind us and the prime contributors enshrined into the Baseball Hall of Fame already, defeats the point. A greater understanding and appreciation of what came before Jackie made it over is needed, in the same way that the time before the Emancipation Proclamation stands out and is a reminder of how things once were. Now, is baseball as serious of a matter as slavery and the national climate of those times? Of course not, and it would be asinine to associate the two. But more than any other sport, due to its age and establishment, baseball is more aligned with the history of race relations and social conditions than any other sport. Major League Baseball has a unique place in telling the story of the evolution of American society through its doors, thus it carries the ability to retroactively keep that awareness relevant by making an even greater point to highlight its own history — even by showcasing its prior missteps and corrections. The MLB has done a great job of telling the post-mortem story of African-American inclusion in its ranks, but it is time to raise that relevancy by telling more of the backstory in greater depth. This can be singularly achieved by bringing forward one of the most renowned member of the Negro Leagues and designating recognition for him and the flag he carried for so long: the iconic Paige.However, he was not, and that is where the story begins, as well as where the call for a Satchel Paige Day stands. While highlighting the importance of the breakthrough that Robinson represented is forever important, highlight why that breakthrough was so important and longstanding is told better through the spectrum of spotlighting perhaps the best player who was blocked for much of his career. While there were many greats who never got to eventually see their careers reach the Majors, highlighting Paige shows both the tragedy of why he did not get to work in the Majors until past his 40th birthday and also why it is not as big of an issue as it may be seen either. Despite the fact that the Negro Leagues’ existence was necessitated by the color ban, it was far from a consolation league. There was great pride in the league by those who played in it, the fans that followed it and the communities that hosted it. The idea that this league was not a pride point and that there was only longing for recognition in the MLB is inaccurate and a point that is increasingly lost in history. By recognizing the star that Paige was and the reverence he commanded, it tells an entirely different story: an inspirational one that completes the story of African-Americans in baseball. By further highlighting Paige, we complete the story of baseball and further accent the rightful position of African-American history along with the game.At a time when African-American participation in the game is at a post-integration all-time low, further exposure of the heritage of the game is greatly needed. It is also a time when there are still living participants who competed in both the Negro and Major Leagues who have names that can carry the esteem to speak to this divide, because they lived it. Being opportunistic in these times is not only needed; it's essential. When would be the most opportune time to host such a recognition day ,and what is the best format to do it within? A common complaint from many African-American sports fans is that baseball is not relatable due to the lack of black stars in the game. By returning the game to the format in which Paige built much of his legend, a barnstorming game, that can begin to change. Many times, Negro League All-Star teams would assemble and travel to play against teams made up of stars from the MLB in contests that were a different type of entertainment than the standard MLB product... and were often won by the Negro Leagues teams. The imagery would be potent, and the message would be clear: Baseball and America have continued to move forward. But there is a perpetual need to never forget what got us to where we are now and how the nation’s most perpetual game and league can provide that contest.Satchel Paige is the greatest ambassador of the entire experience of African-American life as seen through the eyes of sport. Major League Baseball has the power and platform to make bring this past into the present... and beyond.In all, seven leagues have been considered as major league caliber: Negro National League (1920-31; listed as NNL1 here), Eastern Colored League (1923-28, and later as the American Negro League, which shut down in 1929; ECL here), East-West League (1932; EWL), Negro Southern League (1932; NSL), Negro National League (the second incarnation, 1933-48; NNL2), and the Negro American League (1937-50; NAL).Because the fortunes of individual leagues and franchises waxed and waned until integration, many of the teams listed appear in more than one of the seven leagues. Nicknames are acceptable as answers.</td>
