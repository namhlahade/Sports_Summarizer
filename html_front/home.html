After that, the experts cover some of the biggest questions answered during the 2021 NFL Playoffs: which players helped or hurt their fantasy draft value the most; and how much stock we should put into playoff performances? Finally, we wrap up the show with our Jerry Jeudy interview conducted last week at Super Bowl LVI Radio Row.

He can resume activities after about 48 hours.“I think right now the doctors feel totally fine with him resuming playing,” Donovan said. “I think Zach felt very, very good about the meeting, felt like it went really well just based on some of the interventions, some of the things they did during his visit with the doctor.”LaVine’s participation in Cleveland might be limited based on what team medical personnel and the doctors in Los Angeles decide.“I don’t think Zach has any expectation to try to go to an All-Star game and try to play 30 minutes,” Donovan said. “But certainly, it’s a great honor for him.”LaVine was selected for his second All-Star Game when the reserves were announced Feb. 3. He also is scheduled to participate in the 3-point contest.LaVine missed his third game in a row when Chicago hosted Sacramento on Wednesday. The Bulls’ next game is Feb. 24, when they host Atlanta.</td>
