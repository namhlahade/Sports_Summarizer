                <td>MOBILE, Ala. -- Saturday marked the NFL's first Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCU) Combine. Held in partnership with the Senior Bowl, the event provided exposure and opportunity to draft prospects who deserve a chance to prove they can play at the next level.All 32 teams were represented on an unusually cold weekend in Mobile, with evaluators spending Friday interviewing and measuring 39 prospects from 22 different HBCUs. On Saturday, a large group of scouts spent several hours testing and working out the NFL hopefuls at the University of South Alabama Jaguar Training Center.Several league executives, including Executive Vice President of Football Operations Troy Vincent and Director of Football Development Kevin Boothe, helped lead the effort to make Saturday's event a reality. There will be ongoing conversations in the weeks to come about how to make it even better for players and scouts, but this was an important start.The main goal for players was simple: Open eyes and force teams to go back to study their game tape. Here are five prospects who stood out.</td>
