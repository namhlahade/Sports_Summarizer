                <td>The Detroit Lions hold the No. 2 overall pick in the 2022 NFL Draft and, with needs up and down a 3-win roster, could look to trade down to acquire more ammunition.Speaking from the Senior Bowl this week in Mobile, Alabama, Lions general manager Brad Holmes told NFL Network’s Tom Pelissero that he'd consider trading out of his top pick."I'm always open for whatever," Holmes said. "We're still in the early stages of it, we've got a good feel of the class, we're at a much better place at this stage of the process than last year. But, still, we've got a lot more work to do. But, I'm never scared to move around, so we're definitely open for business, always."With the lack of sure-fire franchise quarterbacks atop the 2022 NFL Draft, moving down could be challenging. There are likely several teams in the top 10 that would like to trade down to stockpile additional draft assets, like the Lions, but finding a trade partner willing to move up for a non-QB position could prove difficult.The Lions hold the No. 2 pick in the first round and will also select either 31st or 32nd, depending on the outcome of Super Bowl LVI between the Los Angeles Rams and Cincinnati Bengals, after acquiring the Rams' 2022 first-round pick in the ﻿Matthew Stafford﻿ trade last offseason.Detroit has needs all over the roster, from edge rusher to wide receiver to quarterback.﻿Jared Goff﻿ sits as the placeholder QB in Detroit after an up-and-down 2021 season. With the 2022 draft offering question marks at the position, the Lions could kick the quarterback further down the road and ride Goff another season. However, it would make sense for Detroit to add a young signal-caller to groom at some point during the draft.Holmes was tepid on Goff when asked about his future under center in Detroit."Jared knows what he has to do this offseason, heading into 2022," the GM said. "He's got to show improvement. He finished the season off, that second half well. He battled through some adversity early, but I like how he stayed the course, played some good football late. But he's got to show up and do it again and compete."Who Goff will be competing with is an unknown at this stage. At the Senior Bowl, the Lions coaching staff is working with Liberty's Malik Willis, North Carolina's Sam Howell and Western Kentucky's Bailey Zappe. Detroit will also get an up-close look at Pittsburgh's Kenny Pickett, Cincinnati's Desmond Ridder and Nevada's Carson Strong during Senior Bowl week.</td>

                <td>﻿Eric Weddle﻿ retired for two seasons before making a stunning comeback for the Los Angeles Rams' playoff run to the Super Bowl this season.The 37-year-old played 19 snaps in Los Angeles' Wild Card Round win over the Arizona Cardinals, then saw his play time boost to 60 plays in the Divisional Round win over Tampa Bay. In Sunday's NFC Championship victory over San Francisco, Weddle played all 50 snaps, leading the Rams with nine tackles and a tackle for loss.Weddle said on AM 570 LA Sports this week that, following Super Bowl LVI, it's back to retired life."It's amazing to be able to understand that and know that I don't have to save myself for next season, I don't have to save myself for the offseason, I didn't have to save myself for the Super Bowl last week knowing it wasn't guaranteed, so I was throwing it in there, giving it everything I got," Weddle said, per Nicholas Cothrel of SI.com. "Because listen, I don't have anything left after this other than going back and doing what I was doing before. After this Super Bowl, I move on and go back to my old life and there will be no comebacks. There will not be playing -- another team, another game -- no, no, no, no."Weddle's return is a testament to his work ethic and heady play. Not many players can jump from the proverbial couch back into an NFL defense and perform at a high level, let alone lead the team in tackles in a championship game.A two-time All-Pro and six-time Pro Bowler, Weddle now chases that elusive Super Bowl ring that evaded him his first 13 seasons. A win over the Cincinnati Bengals in Super Bowl LVI would make his return to retirement that much more delicious.</td>

                <td>The Baltimore Ravens shuffled defensive coordinators, parting ways with Don "Wink" Martindale and hiring Mike Macdonald away from the University of Michigan. The change was partly to shake up a defense that began to falter in 2021.Martindale was a heavy-pressure coordinator, throwing a cavalcade of blitzes which left quarterbacks never quite sure where the pressure was coming from. In 2020, the Ravens led the NFL in blitz percent (45.3%). In 2021, that figure fell to No. 6 (32.4%), per Next Gen Stats.The change in coordinator signifies a desire to rely less on the blitz moving forward, but Macdonald said Wednesday that doesn't mean lacking aggression."The aggressiveness absolutely is going to carry over, but I think you've got to look through the lens [of], 'What does aggressiveness actually mean?'" Macdonald said, via the team's official website. "It's about keeping the offense off-balance and where they're not really believing what they're seeing on a down-to-down basis. So, a lot of times, that will come with the schemed-up pressure -- that'll happen. A lot of times it could be a fake pressure, it could look like this coverage and play like another one. You're changing the stress points of the zones and things like that and just trying to create doubt at all times. You want to be the one pushing the envelope, rather than the other way around."Macdonald spent seven seasons with the Ravens working his way from coaching intern in 2014 to defensive assistant (2015-2016), to defensive backs coach (2017) and finally linebackers coach (2018-2020). His familiarity with the mainstays of Baltimore's system should lead to a fluid changeover.In one year as defensive coordinator at Michigan under John Harbaugh's brother, Jim, Macdonald's defense did attack, but it usually wasn't in the form of all-out pressure. Instead, Macdonald mixed coverages behind pressures to throw off quarterbacks. Utilizing a mix of zone and man, and disguising pressures, Michigan's defense went from the 95th ranked scoring unit to eighth in 2021, allowing just 17.4 points per game. It helped that Michigan boasted two potential first-round picks in the 2022 NFL Draft in Aidan Hutchinson and David Ojabo."It's just the willingness to just try to keep putting your players in the best position so they can succeed," Macdonald said. "If you let that kind of guide your decision process, you end up at a pretty decent spot."The first thing you want is a cohesive unit. You want everybody to have each other's backs. There's a certain style it takes to play like a Raven. You want it to be multiple. You want it to be flexible and adaptable. It needs to be complimentary, light enough when you can adjust to certain things and simple for the players so they can go play the way you expect them to go play."The Ravens' secondary was decimated by injury in 2021, and Baltimore will have several key free agents to make decisions on, including defensive lineman Calais Campbell and edge rusher Justin Houston﻿. But with pieces like Odafe Oweh﻿, who is coming off an impressive rookie campaign, the building blocks are there for Baltimore to get back to being a lock-down unit."Ultimately, our goal is not even top 10, right?" Macdonald said. "You want to be No. 1. So, that's the standard."</td>

               <td>Here, we honor Robinson with Jackie Robinson's life as told for 42 photos for No. 42.Jack Roosevelt Robinson was born Jan. 31, 1919, in Cairo, Georgia. Jackie (second from the left) was the youngest of five brothers and sisters. Robinson's stay in Georgia was short-lived, as he moved with mother and siblings to California shortly after his father left in 1920. Robinson became a four-sport star at UCLA, earning varsity letters in baseball, football, basketball and track and field. Robinson won the 1940 NCAA Men’s Track and Field Championships in the long jump. Surprisingly, in addition to playing football and basketball, he played just one season of baseball at UCLA, hitting only .097, not the start you’d expect to lead to a Hall of Fame MLB career.Robinson was drafted in 1942 and served until 1944 when he received an honorable discharge after an incident where he refused to sit in the back of a military bus. He never actually saw any combat. Robinson signed with the Kansas City Monarchs of the Negro Leagues, and it was here where he drew the attention of Brooklyn Dodgers general manager Branch Rickey. Robinson married his college sweetheart in February 1946. The couple welcomed its first child to the world later that year. Late in 1945 Robinson signed his historic deal with the Brooklyn Dodgers, paving the way for him to become the first black player in Major League Baseball. Robinson spent 1946 in Montreal playing for the Royals, the AAA affiliate of the Dodgers. Just prior to the start of the 1947 season, Robinson gets the call from the Dodgers to come and join the big league club. He is assigned No. 42, which would go on to become arguably the most iconic jersey number in MLB history. The Dodgers manager at the time was the legendary Leo Durocher, who was an outspoken champion for Robinson breaking the MLB color barrier. Robinson makes his MLB debut on April 15, 1947, drawing a walk and scoring a run in a 5-3 win. While not everyone on the Dodgers was excited to have Robinson on the team, most of his new teammates followed their manager's lead and welcomed him with open arms. Robinson's first year was an unmitigated success, where he hit just under .300 while leading the league in stolen bases on his way to his first World Series. For his efforts, he was named Rookie of the Year. One teammate in particular who came out in strong support of Robinson was Pee Wee Reese, who memorably once put his arm around Robinson, a gesture that was later memorialized as a statue in Brooklyn. Jackie Robinson was the first black player to make the All-Star team in 1949, and he made it five more times in each of the next five seasons. Robinson's trials and tribulations while dealing with racism on and off the field are well-documented, but perhaps no one was as outspoken as Phillies manager Ben Chapman, who often hurled racial epithets at Robinson from the Philadelphia dugout. Long before his career ended, Robinson used his newfound fame to become a champion of civil rights across the United States. In the middle of his run with the Dodgers, Robinson starred in his own biopic in 1950, opposite Ruby Dee. Mr. and Mrs. Robinson ended up with a total of three kids: Jackie Jr., Sharon and David. Robinson took a role at NBC in 1952, which would later lead to him breaking into broadcasting following his retirement from baseball. A few months after Robinson's debut, Larry Doby broke the color barrier in the American League, and the two quickly became close friends. Robinson's best year as a Dodger came in 1949 when he led the league in batting average and steals while also scoring 122 runs and knocking in 124 runs on his way to his one and only NL MVP award. The Dodgers made it to the World Series a remarkable six times during Jackie Robinson's tenure there but were bested by the Yankees during five of those trips. In 1955, the Dodgers finally got over the hump and defeated their crosstown adversary, giving Robinson his only World Series ring. While the title would make the Dodgers the toast of the city, the celebration would be short-lived, as they would move to Los Angeles in 1957, one year after Robinson retired. Robinson was all over the political spectrum, supporting candidates like Hubert Humphrey...… to Nelson Rockefeller...... to meeting Fidel Castro...... and even supporting Richard Nixon's presidential candidacy. Robinson spent the late 1950s and early part of the 1960s fighting for civil rights...... including in this photo with boxer Floyd Patterson before the two boarded a flight to Birmingham. A little-remembered fact about Robinson is that the Dodgers actually traded him to the Giants following the 1956 season. However...... he never suited up for them, instead announcing his retirement from professional baseball at the age of 37. Upon retirement, Robinson became president of the Chock Full O' Nuts company. Robinson was elected to Cooperstown in 1962, his first year of eligibility on the ballot. He broke down another color barrier, becoming the first African-American to be given baseball's highest honor. In the late '60s Robinson did broadcast work for both ABC and the Montreal Expos, the city where his professional career began. In 1966, Robinson became general manager of the Brooklyn Dodgers...of the Continental Football League, a pro football league that existed from 1965 to 1969. Jackie Robinson died on Oct. 24, 1972, from a heart attack at the age of 53. Nearly 3,000 people attended his funeral.On April 15, 1997, Jackie Robinson became the first athlete to have his number retired league-wide. To this day, every player in the league sports No. 42 on April 15 as a tribute to the iconic Robinson. </td>

               <td>The story of the various baseball organizations that collectively formed the Negro Leagues over the first half of the 20th century is vital to telling the story of the game to this day.This list highlights the legacies of the greatest black players during the segregated era of professional baseball. Ranging from the Negro Leagues to Cuban and Mexican pro leagues and the barnstorming circuit that pitted black and white stars of the day against each other, this is a look at the players who carried the most acclaim from the era. While statistics can be inconsistent, the recollection of the talent lives on.Here is a look at 25 of the greatest performers in the distinguished (and varied) history of Negro League baseball.James Thomas Bell was a star center fielder for the St. Louis Stars, Pittsburgh Crawfords and Homestead Grays, among others. Regarded as the greatest speedster not only of the Negro Leagues but also in baseball history, Bell’s speed made him a tremendous threat. His prowess on the base paths resembled the style of an Ichiro in the contemporary game, but to a greater degree. He was an eight-time All-Star, a .337 career hitter in the Negro Leagues and was elected to the Baseball Hall of Fame in 1974.One of the most prodigious power hitters in the history of black baseball, Brown was a force at the heart of Kansas City Monarchs lineup. He became a legend in both the United States and Puerto Rico, where he was also a top performer for years. He was an aggressive presence at the plate, with raw power that was said to be on par with Josh Gibson. Brown eventually joined the St. Louis Browns and became the first African-American to homer in the American League in 1947.Half brother of fellow pitcher and legendary manager and executive Rube Foster, the younger Foster brother is considered the best southpaw in Negro League history. While he possessed great speed on his fastball, it was his complete arsenal that made him most dangerous. He starred for his brother’s powerhouse Chicago American Giants club throughout the 1920s and won three championships along the way.No man had a bigger guiding influence over the direction and enduring legacy of the Negro Leagues than Foster, who is known as the "Father of Black Baseball.” As an owner and executive of the Negro National League, he oversaw the longest-lasting single entity of the Negro League era, lasting from 1920 to 1931. Before turning his attention to the front office, Foster was the greatest pitcher of the early Negro League era. Legend has it that he once won over 50 games in a season in 1905, and even if that overwhelming feat is not completely documentable, remaining box scores from the season do credit him with a 25-3 record on the year.One of the final stars of the Negro Leagues, Irvin starred for the Newark Eagles over the course of nine seasons. Although his stint in the league was interrupted by a contract dispute that saw him depart for the Mexican Professional Leagues once and World War II another time, Irvin was one of the greatest hitters the league saw. He hit over .350 in three different seasons and won MVP of the Puerto Rico Winter League before becoming an MLB All-Star. He won the 1952 World Series alongside Willie Mays with the New York Giants.Johnson was a star at third base for the Hilldale Club, Homestead Grays and, most famously, Pittsburgh Crawfords throughout his 16-year career. He was a defensive wiz and regarded as arguably the best pure glove at the position ever. He was a member of what is considered the most talented Negro Leagues team ever assembled, when he joined Satchel Paige, Josh Gibson, Oscar Charleston and Cool Papa Bell on the Crawfords in 1932. Johnson later became instrumental in getting Negro Leaguers inducted into the National Baseball Hall of Fame in 1970s.Mackey was the premier defensive catcher of black baseball throughout the early years of the Negro National League. He had a long career that began in 1918 and finished in 1950. Mackey’s strong arm, game-calling and skill behind the plate were unrivaled, and he served as an early mentor to future three-time National League MVP Roy Campanella.The most renowned player and personality ever seen in black baseball, Paige’s exploits on the mound spanned over 40 years while taking on a mythical ethos along the way. Paige’s talent for showmanship helped draw massive crowds wherever he traveled, while his gifts on the mound made good on the hype that surrounded him every time he took the mound. Thus was the marriage of confidence, bravado and skill that he possessed, Paige would call in the defense from the field and still strike out the side. Underneath all of that, Paige was an extraordinarily talented power pitcher who had two distinct parts of his career. When he was young, his fastball was overwhelming enough that he used it exclusively. Then as he got older, he integrated in several off-speed pitches that he used just as effectively. Some still consider Paige the best pitcher in the history of the game.As his nickname indicates, Radcliffe was a busy man. He was a two-way star on the field and a well-traveled one off it, playing for over 30 teams during his lengthy career. On one end of a doubleheader in 1932 Negro Leagues World Series, he caught Satchel Paige in Game 1, then threw a shutout of his own as the starter of Game 2. Radcliffe made multiple All-Star appearances as both a catcher and pitcher and often changed positions throughout the season as his team needs demanded it. Later in his career, Radcliffe roomed with a young Jackie Robinson during his tenure with the Kansas City Monarchs in the mid-1940s.Standing in at over 6-foot-0 and 200 pounds, Redding was one of the most intimidating hurlers in the game during his time. His fastball was notoriously hard, earning him the “Cannonball Dıck” moniker. He was also an innovator on the mound, capable of working from multiple delivery points to make his famous fastball even tougher to deal with. Across his career, Redding was credited with 30 no-hitters and often pitched both ends of doubleheaders.Owner of a devastating curveball and a fastball that was at the very least on par with Satchel Paige’s, Rogan is among the best pitchers the Negro Leagues ever saw. By some accounts, it is said he won more games than any pitcher in black baseball history. The story did not stop on the mound with Rogan, as he was just as talented with a bat in his hands. His two-way talents saw him perform as both an ace hurler for the Kansas City Monarchs and the team’s cleanup hitter. Rogan led the club to a victory in the first Negro League World Series in 1924.As the No. 2 in the Kansas City Monarchs' rotation behind Satchel Paige, Smith was an integral part of Negro Leagues history. It could be argued that he was the best reliever in the Negro Leagues. He often paired with Paige to work complete games, pitching the final five to six innings after Paige opened affairs. Smith possessed one of the best curveballs of his time, so much so that many of his opponents preferred to face the most daunting of fastballs than have to figure out the landing point of his breaking ball.A phenomenal talent who wielded a powerful bat that was rivaled by his top-end speed, Stearnes was one of the most gifted outfielders in the history of the game. Recent studies have credited him with home run totals that rivaled (if not surpassed) those of Josh Gibson. Otherwise a quiet, low-key type, Stearnes was known for talking to his bats to motivate or chastise them into performing. His accounted for career statistics included three seasons of hitting over .400 and 176 home runs.A strapping, powerful presence, Suttles was one of the elite power hitters in the history of black baseball. His home runs were monumental, often traveling over 500 feet. Suttles affirmed his presence on the barnstorming circuit and in the East-West All-Star Games, where he hit over .400 in six appearances throughout the 1930s. While spending much of his career in left field, he spent his final seasons as a first baseman with the Newark Eagles as a member of the prized “Million Dollar Infield.”A native of Cuba and star of the Cuban Leagues before making his way to America, Torriente was a phenomenal hitter capable of power to all fields. The hard-hitting, left-handed center fielder was proclaimed to be the “Babe Ruth of Cuba.” Torriente took black baseball by storm upon reaching the Negro Leagues, starring for Rube Foster’s Chicago American Giants and making them a dominant force of the mid-1920s. Torriente won two batting titles and three championships with the Giants and maintained a .331 career Negro Leagues batting average.A dizzying collective of speed and glove work, Wells was one of the greatest defenders to ever play the game. Nicknamed “El Diablo” or “The Devil” during his time in the Mexican Leagues due to taking away anything hit in his direction, Wells reportedly produced multiple errorless seasons at the game’s toughest defensive slot. He was just as capable at the plate, possessing a power, contact and speed package that made him one of the most complete players ever. He played the keystone alongside fellow Hall of Famers Mule Suttles and Ray Dandridge in the Newark Eagles' “Million Dollar Infield.”Known as both “Smokey Joe” or “Cyclone Joe,” Williams was a dominant force on the mound and one of the greatest pitchers in black baseball. It is said that Williams was the hardest-throwing pitcher of his time and among the fastest ever still. In 1930, Williams struck out 27 Kansas City Monarchs over a 12-inning shutout victory. On the barnstorming circuit, he truly showed that he was beyond reproach at the time, as he bested MLB stars Walter Johnson, Grover Cleveland Alexander and Chief Bender, among others. In the most telling and unlikely endorsement of his abilities, none other than Ty Cobb once said that Williams would be a “sure 30-game winner” in MLB.</td>

               <td>While these and many more legends have grown to enduring status, there should be legitimate concern that the reality of the conditions in which they occurred could be lost to time. In a country that is both fighting to be beyond racial divides and combating some clear polarizations that could reverse those efforts, the importance of the era that housed the Negro Leagues and the success that they ultimately bred deserves to be kept prominent and in current context. The idea that we are at a "finish line" of any sort regarding the Negro Leagues era, due to the integration mark being three decades behind us and the prime contributors enshrined into the Baseball Hall of Fame already, defeats the point. A greater understanding and appreciation of what came before Jackie made it over is needed, in the same way that the time before the Emancipation Proclamation stands out and is a reminder of how things once were. Now, is baseball as serious of a matter as slavery and the national climate of those times? Of course not, and it would be asinine to associate the two. But more than any other sport, due to its age and establishment, baseball is more aligned with the history of race relations and social conditions than any other sport. Major League Baseball has a unique place in telling the story of the evolution of American society through its doors, thus it carries the ability to retroactively keep that awareness relevant by making an even greater point to highlight its own history — even by showcasing its prior missteps and corrections. The MLB has done a great job of telling the post-mortem story of African-American inclusion in its ranks, but it is time to raise that relevancy by telling more of the backstory in greater depth. This can be singularly achieved by bringing forward one of the most renowned member of the Negro Leagues and designating recognition for him and the flag he carried for so long: the iconic Paige.However, he was not, and that is where the story begins, as well as where the call for a Satchel Paige Day stands. While highlighting the importance of the breakthrough that Robinson represented is forever important, highlight why that breakthrough was so important and longstanding is told better through the spectrum of spotlighting perhaps the best player who was blocked for much of his career. While there were many greats who never got to eventually see their careers reach the Majors, highlighting Paige shows both the tragedy of why he did not get to work in the Majors until past his 40th birthday and also why it is not as big of an issue as it may be seen either. Despite the fact that the Negro Leagues’ existence was necessitated by the color ban, it was far from a consolation league. There was great pride in the league by those who played in it, the fans that followed it and the communities that hosted it. The idea that this league was not a pride point and that there was only longing for recognition in the MLB is inaccurate and a point that is increasingly lost in history. By recognizing the star that Paige was and the reverence he commanded, it tells an entirely different story: an inspirational one that completes the story of African-Americans in baseball. By further highlighting Paige, we complete the story of baseball and further accent the rightful position of African-American history along with the game.At a time when African-American participation in the game is at a post-integration all-time low, further exposure of the heritage of the game is greatly needed. It is also a time when there are still living participants who competed in both the Negro and Major Leagues who have names that can carry the esteem to speak to this divide, because they lived it. Being opportunistic in these times is not only needed; it's essential. When would be the most opportune time to host such a recognition day ,and what is the best format to do it within? A common complaint from many African-American sports fans is that baseball is not relatable due to the lack of black stars in the game. By returning the game to the format in which Paige built much of his legend, a barnstorming game, that can begin to change. Many times, Negro League All-Star teams would assemble and travel to play against teams made up of stars from the MLB in contests that were a different type of entertainment than the standard MLB product... and were often won by the Negro Leagues teams. The imagery would be potent, and the message would be clear: Baseball and America have continued to move forward. But there is a perpetual need to never forget what got us to where we are now and how the nation’s most perpetual game and league can provide that contest.Satchel Paige is the greatest ambassador of the entire experience of African-American life as seen through the eyes of sport. Major League Baseball has the power and platform to make bring this past into the present... and beyond.In all, seven leagues have been considered as major league caliber: Negro National League (1920-31; listed as NNL1 here), Eastern Colored League (1923-28, and later as the American Negro League, which shut down in 1929; ECL here), East-West League (1932; EWL), Negro Southern League (1932; NSL), Negro National League (the second incarnation, 1933-48; NNL2), and the Negro American League (1937-50; NAL).Because the fortunes of individual leagues and franchises waxed and waned until integration, many of the teams listed appear in more than one of the seven leagues. Nicknames are acceptable as answers.</td>
