"How we use him, that's going to be on me. It's our responsibility, my responsibility to make sure we put him in positions so he can be at his very best, and we know how great he is at doing that.  With each time Adams got picked on in coverage, the discussion got louder.In 12 games, Adams didn't record a sack for the first time in his career while earning 87 tackles, and five passes defended with two interceptions.Hurtt harped Wednesday on his desire to be more "aggressive" as he adds elements of the Vic Fangio-style defense to Seattle.</td>

The offensive line helped us get to the Super Bowl.

The offense now will fully be Carmichael's after he occasionally called plays when Payton was at the helm.The Saints offense finished 28th in yards and 19th in points during a 2021 season that saw New Orleans start four different quarterbacks (Jameis Winston, Taysom Hill, Trevor Siemian and Ian Book).</td>

               <td>DeMar DeRozan continues his streak of 30+ point games with 38 points in the win over the Kings.DeMar DeRozan has done something not even the revered Michael Jordan ever did in Chicago.DeRozan finished with 38 points on 16-for-27 shooting in Wednesday’s 125-118 win against the Sacramento Kings and, in doing so, pushed past Wilt Chamberlain in the NBA record books. DeRozan became the first player in NBA history to score 35 or more points and shoot 50% or better in seven consecutive games. Chamberlain did it in six straight twice — during the 1960-61 and 1962-63 seasons.Jordan, the Bulls’ all-time leader in just about every major statistical category, still holds the franchise record for most consecutive games with 35 or more points at 10. However, in ringing up 35 or more points for the seventh straight game, DeRozan has tied Jordan for the second-longest such streak in franchise history .It was also DeRozan’s eighth game in a row with 30 or more points overall, marking the longest such streak by a Bulls player since Jordan did (eight straight in January 1996).DeRozan had difficulty describing just how locked in he is. And when it came to the record, he was “speechless.”“As a kid, as a fan of the history of the game, being in the league as long as I’ve been in this league — things like that continue to make me even more humble,” he said. “Being an NBA player and being able to have the privilege to be able to play this long and have these opportunities, man, it’s something I never take for granted. And the crazy thing is I felt like I missed eight easy shots I normally would have made.”Bulls star DeMar DeRozan has found a rhythm and system on offense in Chicago that is playing to his strengths.DeRozan hit the 30-point mark when he nailed a 15-footer off a crossover to make it 107-98 with 7:10 left. And he made several big shots down the stretch.DeRozan hit a 3 with about 5:15 left after Sacramento pulled within two. He also converted a three-point play to bump the lead to 115-109 with 3:51 remaining, and the Bulls remained in control the rest of the way.In some news apart from DeRozan’s performance, the Bulls are also about to sign Tristan Thompson. Following Indiana’s win against the Washington Wizards, Pacers coach Rick Carlisle told reporters the Pacers will soon waive Thompson — who will then sign with Chicago.DeMar DeRozan talks after Chicago's win about his string of 35-point games.“He’ll be joining a contending team in the East — a little bit north if anybody wants to tweet, starts with a C and ends with an O,” Carlisle said Wednesday night.In case there was any doubt, Carlisle clarified: “Chicago, if anybody didn’t get that.”For his part, Bulls coach Billy Donovan said he had not heard “anything along the lines of that happening” and said it was “the first I’m hearing of it.”</td>

A reminder on The Horry Scale: It breaks down a game-winning buzzer-beater (GWBB) in the categories of difficulty, game situation (was the team tied or behind at the time?), importance (playoff game or garden-variety night in November?) and celebration. Then we give it an overall grade on a scale of 1-5 Robert Horrys, named for the patron saint of last-second answered prayers.* * *On an 11-game night filled with upsets and wild comebacks, Golden State’s home game with Denver was a rare exception. For the first 47-plus minutes, at least, during which the Warriors led uninterrupted by as many as 16 points. That set the stage for a truly wild finish featuring the game’s only three lead changes in the final 14.9 seconds, the last coming on Monte Morris’ buzzer-beating 3-pointer to give the Nuggets a 117-116 victory.GAME SITUATION: The Warriors were never ultimately able to but the Nuggets away, but they always seemed to be in solid control as they led from the opening tip. But when you’re facing Nikola Jokic, no advantage is safe. Fueled by his all-around brilliance, the Nuggets chipped away and finally took their first lead of the game on Morris’ unassisted layup with 14.9 seconds remaining.The Warriors went to — who else? — Stephen Curry on their ensuing possession, and he delivered with a tough 18-footer over Morris despite being fouled. His free throw gave the Warriors a 116-114 lead with 5.9 seconds left.Mama, there goes that man pic.twitter.com/7BufmpueIw— Golden State Warriors (@warriors) February 17, 2022The Nuggets then went to their superstar, forcing the Warriors to pick their poison: Let Jokic bull into the lane and potentially add to his 35 points, or double and risk him spoon feeding a teammate.Curry chose the latter option, helping off Morris to double down on Jokic as he dribbled into the paint. Morris had inbounded to Jokic on the right sideline, then drifted over to the left wing as he sought to give him a target to do what he does best: Find the open man. Jokic did, and Morris took advantage despite Curry’s frantic recovery contest to drill the game-winner.MONTE MORRIS GAME-WINNER VS. WARRIORS 😱🔥 pic.twitter.com/NZtFWhHxNR— Bleacher Report (@BleacherReport) February 17, 2022  DIFFICULTY: Morris had the fortitude to convert, but Jokic did most of the work on Denver’s final possession, drawing his defender and then hitting him right in the shooting pocket with his feet set. It was the eighth assist of the game for the reigning Kia MVP to go with 35 points (13-for-24 FGs) and 17 rebounds.“The play was obviously for Nikola,” said Morris, a 37.3% 3-point shooter coming in. “But he told me in the timeout to be shot ready just in case. Nikola trusted me; that means a lot for an MVP to give me the ball like that. I just knocked down a shot I practice a lot. It feels good, man.”CELEBRATION: The rapture triggered by Curry’s apparent winner gave way to stunned silence as the Nuggets mobbed Morris in jubilation.GRADE: The sixth-place Nuggets continue to be the little team that could, riding Jokic’s broad back to their ninth victory in 13 games despite crippling injuries. It was a potentially critical step in their quest to avoid the Play-In Tournament, pushing their cushion to three games over No. 7 Minnesota in the loss column and five over the Clippers in eighth place.

               <td>Kyrie Irving, who remains unvaccinated, rejoined the Nets in a part-time capacity for road games in December.NEW YORK (AP) — The Brooklyn Nets are hopeful of a change to a local vaccine mandate that would make Kyrie Irving available for home games, one that New York City’s mayor is “struggling” with whether to make.NBA Commissioner Adam Silver said Wednesday he believed Mayor Eric Adams should look at the mandate, which requires athletes playing for the city’s teams to be vaccinated against the coronavirus to play in public venues.Adams later agreed that there were problems with the rule, which doesn’t apply to visiting players, but said he is hesitant to make a change.The Nets hope he will.“Obviously, we’re hopeful but it’s really out of our hands,” coach Steve Nash said before the Nets beat the Knicks 111-106 at Madison Square Garden without Irving.“We just have to be patient and hope that the oddity of it prevails in a sense, but that’s not in my job description to write the city and state mandates. So I think we are hopeful and we’re patient and we’ll wait for hopefully the best outcome, but whatever outcome it is out of our hands.”Silver said it’s odd that the mandate only applies to players on the local teams while an unvaccinated opponent is allowed to play.NBA commissioner Adam Silver weighs in on the New York vaccine requirements, which have kept Kyrie Irving out of home games.“It just doesn’t quite make sense to me that an away player who’s unvaccinated can play in Barclays, but the home player can’t." pic.twitter.com/epMYGZhYdz— Get Up (@GetUpESPN) February 16, 2022“I mean, I think if ultimately that rule is about protecting people who are in the arena, it just doesn’t quite make sense to me that an away player who’s unvaccinated can play in Barclays but the home player can’t,” Silver said in an interview with ESPN.Adams was asked at a news conference later about Silver’s comments and whether he might adjust the rule. Adams, the former Brooklyn Borough president, said he was struggling with the contradiction, which also allows unvaccinated entertainers from out of town to perform in the city.“I think the rule is unfair. I believe that we are saying to out-of-town athletes that they can come in and not be vaccinated. Yet New York athletes, you have to be vaccinated,” said Adams, who replaced former Mayor Bill de Blasio, who imposed the city’s vaccine requirements last year.“But I am really, really leery about sending the wrong message,” Adams said. “Having this city close down again keeps me up at night. And the message was put in place, the rule was put in place. To start changing it now, I think it would send mixed messages. So I’m struggling with this, just to be honest with you.”More than 95% of NBA players are vaccinated. The Nets originally didn’t let Irving play in any games until he was cleared to play in all of them but reversed their decision in December when the team was short-handed after a coronavirus outbreak on the team.* * *Associated Press writer Michelle L.

Rask had appeared in just four games this season after signing a one-year contract with the Bruins in January, going 2-2 with a 4.28 goals against average."When I made the decision to have surgery on my hip last summer, I did so knowing that the road to recovery would be challenging.
